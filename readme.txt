This plugin allows the user to automatically append a link to the current page, when users copy & paste a title or any line.

== Description ==

With this Plugin you can automatically add text or html to content that is copied from your page.

If a visitor copies any kind of text from the website, a link to the page is appended, so if it is pasted elsewhere, a link to the page is maintained.

right now you can:

* specify the Read more link text, default: 
* how many <br /> tags should be inserted below the copied text and the link or copyright notice
* specify if you want the current page title included
* see previews of HTML and text versions of the copied text and link

I plan to increase the functionality with:

* some internationalisation
* if somebody wants to contribute legacy IE support I'll include that

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `append-link-on-copy` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/` on your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work perfectly in all browsers? =

Yes. Internet Explorer is not a browser.

== Screenshots ==

1. This shows the backend and the options the user has.
2. This shows the copied text in an HTML capable destination
3. This shows the copied text in a plain text capable destination

== Changelog ==
